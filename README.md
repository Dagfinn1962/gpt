# Quest
 This is a web app that integrates GPT-3 with google searches.

 Currently the search does not go into links and is restricted to the google page.

 Anyone willing to help build this tool is welcome to send merge requests.

## Setup

Install [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

Download the [install.bat](https://github.com/farrael004/Quest/blob/main/install.bat) (Windows) or [install.sh](https://github.com/farrael004/Quest/blob/main/install.sh) (macOS/Linux) file by right clicking the ```Raw``` button and 'Save link As...'.

Double click the `install` file.

## Problems installing?

If when you double-click ```install.bat``` it gives you an error. Open it using notepad and edit the following lines to ```py``` instead of ```python```. Then double-click the ```install.bat``` file again.

### Google search

To use the Google search box, enter a query in the text input and hit 'Submit'. This will trigger a search on Google using your query. The results will be listed and a summary of the findings from this search will be displayed.

### Assistant settings

The Assistant settings serves to determine how closely the Assistant will stick with the Google search. If you set it to `Strictly Factual`, it will try to not say any facts beyond the Google search. The further away from `Strictly Factual` the more it will allow itself to generate creative responses based on the search and it will be less concerned with being factual.
