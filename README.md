# Quest
 This is a web app that integrates GPT-3 with google searches.

 Currently the search does not go into links and is restricted to the google page.

 Anyone willing to help build this tool is welcome to send merge requests.

## Setup (for running locally)

Install [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

Download/Clone this repo.

In the repo folder, create a file called `api_key.txt`. Paste your Open AI API in this file. You can find your API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Double click the `install.bat` file.

## Run locally

To quickly open the app after installation, double-click the `start.bat` file (Windows only). A command shell will open and two links will be displayed. Navigate to any of the two links in your browser.

## Usage

There are three main sections in this app. The 'Assistant settings', the 'Ask me anything', and the 'Google search'.

### Google search

To use the Google search box, enter a query in the text input and hit 'Submit'. This will trigger a search on Google using your query. The results will be listed and a summary of the findings from this search will be displayed.

### Ask me anything

The summary generated by this box will be used by the Assistant in the 'Ask me anything' box.

### Assistant settings

The Assistant settings serves to determine how closely the Assistant will stick with the Google search. If you set it to `Strictly Factual`, it will try to not say any facts beyond the Google search. The further away from `Strictly Factual` the more it will allow itself to generate creative responses based on the search and it will be less concerned with being factual.
