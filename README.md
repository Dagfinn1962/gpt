# Quest
 This is a web app that integrates GPT-3 with google searches.

 Currently the search does not go into links and is restricted to the google page.

 Anyone willing to help build this tool is welcome to send merge requests.

## Setup (for running locally)

Install [python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

Download `stream_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, `install.bat` (Windows only), and `start.bat` (Windows only). Put these files in a folder.

In this folder, create a file called `api_key.txt`. Paste your Open AI API in this file. You can find your API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Double click the `install.bat` file.

## Run locally

To quickly open the app after installation, double-click the `start.bat` file (Windows only). A command shell will open and two links will be displayed. Navigate to any of the two links in your browser.
